# C-Sharp-Intermediate
Learning more C#

Now that you have a working knowledge of C#, it's time to take a deeper dive and learn the intermediate language features of C#. 
In this track, you'll learn how to use C#'s integrated query language—LINQ—to query data, extend types using extension methods, 
and create data structures using generics. You'll also learn how to use the powerful Visual Studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to develop, debug, and test your code.
